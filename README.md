# WordSquish

The same project prompt as [Dongle](https://github.com/rotondozer/team-dongle-front-end). A group project assigned from General Assembly, with the prompt as:

>## Content Management System
> Build an app to build a website! Your app must allow non-technical users to write blog posts and pages for the site. When a visitor visits your site, they should see content. When a user logs in, they should see a dashboard that lets them create and edit new posts or pages.

## Why WordSquish?

I wanted to take a fresh, **individual** approach to the group project without altering the finished project which my group delivered. So, I made a brand new client using **_React_** and **_Semantic UI_** (only minor changes were made to the API).

Also, I wanted to change the name.

## Technologies
* React.js
* Semantic UI
* CSS
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* MongoDB

## Future Iterations

The most notable improvement I would make with another iteration of this project is to make the _Pages_ more robust. With the original time allotted, we needed to keep the scope of the project very small. Although the prompt was clearly hinting at making a WordPress-y application, 4 days simply was not enough time to allow users to create fully customizable static pages. If I were to dive back into Express, I could add more sections for pages in the database, permitting color selections, navbars and img uploads to name a few.
